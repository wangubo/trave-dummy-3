          Camping is a recreational (and oftentimes laid-back) activity pursued
          outdoors, away from cities and towns and in the lap of nature, with
          fresh air and (occasionally) wildlife for company. One can set up a
          tent, or live in a caravan, camper-van or motor-home when camping. But
          the classic camping trip involves toughing it out in tents – and at
          the mercy of Mother Nature. Camping can be – and usually is – combined
          with other adventure activities, such as hiking/trekking, fishing,
          whitewater rafting and kayaking, giving one the ultimate outdoors
          experience. It can be an individual pursuit, but is often done in the
          company of friends and family. It’s a pastime that can be enjoyed by
          the young and the old. Camping is also a convenient option for those
          attending music festivals or sports gatherings. While camping has
          moved on from its rough-and-ready, back-to-nature origins, hardy folks
          are still willing to rough it out in the wilderness, no matter how
          conspiratorial the elements might be. But for families, with kids in
          tow, camping is the perfect activity for a vacation.

          One strategy has proved particularly successful across all sectors of
          the industry. Whether you are a provider of boat tours, cooking
          courses or run an escape room – vouchers have proven to help all
          providers, especially during the lockdown. Although tours could not be
          offered, dreaming about them and buying them in advance was
          nonetheless still possible, and helped some providers weather the
          storm. People want something to look forward to, especially when
          redemption dates are flexible. The providers we spoke to are
          particularly keen to make their voucher offers highly visible.
          Directly and prominently featured on their homepage, potential
          customers get all the important information about the current
          promotions and find out at a glance why they should buy vouchers right
          now. In our example from Virtual Lounge aus Braunschweig the action
          description is followed by a colour-coded button with a clear request
          to buy. After clicking on the button, you are taken directly to the
          overview of all offers and can book immediately.

          Tour guides lead visitors, individually or in groups, on tours less
          than a day in length. Tour guides ensure that itineraries are met and
          that customers are being informed in an entertaining manner the
          location they are touring. They are also responsible for ensuring the
          safety of the group and ensuring that tour groups remain together.
          Tour guides are employed by tour companies, resorts and attractions.
